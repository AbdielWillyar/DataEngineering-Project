Welcome to the Personal Loan Marketing Campaign Data Management project! In this project, we will address the need of a bank to efficiently manage the data collected during a recent marketing campaign aimed at promoting personal loans. Personal loans are a significant revenue stream for banks, with the potential to generate substantial interest income. It's crucial to streamline the data management process to support future marketing campaigns effectively.
