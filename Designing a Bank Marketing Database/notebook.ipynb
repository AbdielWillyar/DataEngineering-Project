{"cells":[{"source":"![piggy_bank](piggy_bank.jpg)\n\n<br>\n\nPersonal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!\n\nYou have been asked to work with a bank to clean and store the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data, designing the schema in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported. \n\nThey have supplied you with a csv file called `\"bank_marketing.csv\"`, which you will need to clean, reformat, and split, in order to save separate files based on the tables you will create. It is recommended to use `pandas` for these tasks.\n\nLastly, you will write the SQL code that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. As the bank are quite strict about their security, you'll save SQL files as multiline string variables that they can then use to create the database on their end. \n\nYou have been asked to design a database that will have three tables:\n\n## client\n\n| column | data type | description | original column in dataset |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| `id` | `serial` | Client ID - primary key | `client_id` |\n| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years | `age` |\n| `job` | `text` | Client's type of job | `job` |\n| `marital` | `text` | Client's marital status | `marital` | \n| `education` | `text` | Client's level of education | `education` |\n| `credit_default` | `boolean` | Whether the client's credit is in default | `credit_default` |\n| `housing` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing housing loan (mortgage) | `housing` | \n| `loan` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing personal loan | `loan` |\n\n<br>\n\n##

current campaign | `campaign` |\n| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds | `duration` |\n| `pdays` | `integer` | Number of days since contact in previous campaign (`999` = not previously contacted) | `pdays` |\n| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign | `previous` |\n| `previous_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the previous campaign | `poutcome` |\n| `campaign_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the current campaign | `y` |\n| `last_contact_date` | `date` | Last date the client was contacted | A

preprocessing tasks described in the previous response are essential steps to store and manage the data collected from the bank's marketing campaign effectively. Once the data is organized in a relational database and cleaned, it becomes easier to extract valuable insights and perform various analyses. Here are some potential insights and analyses that can be derived from this data:\n\n**- Customer Segmentation:** By analyzing client demographics (e.g., age, job, marital status, education), you can segment customers into different groups. This can help the bank tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.\n\n**- Loan Default Analysis:** You can analyze the relationship between variables like credit_default, housing, and loan to understand how these factors impact loan default rates.\n\n**- Campaign Effectiveness:** Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by analyzing campaign outcomes. Which campaigns were most successful in converting leads into customers, and why?\n\n**- Contact Strategy Optimization:** Determine the optimal number of contact attempts (number_contacts) and contact duration that maximize campaign success while minimizing customer annoyance.\n\n**- Previous Campaign Analysis:** Investigate the impact of previous campaign outcomes (previous_outcome) on the current campaign's success. Did successful outcomes in previous campaigns lead to higher conversion rates?\n \n**- Economic Factors:** Analyze the influence of economic factors (emp_var_rate, cons_price_idx, euribor_three_months, number_employed) on customer behavior, such as loan uptake or campaign response.\n\n**- Trends Over Time:** Examine how customer behavior and campaign outcomes change over time by analyzing data over different time periods, possibly using the last_contact_date.\n\n**- Cross-Tabulations:** Create cross-tabulations to understand relationships between categorical variables like job, marital status, and education and how they relate to loan uptake or campaign success.\n\n**- Predictive Modeling:** Build predictive models to forecast customer behavior, such as the likelihood of taking out a personal loan based on historical data.\n\n**- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Calculate CLV for different customer segments to identify which segments are the most valuable in the long run.\n\n**- Recommendation Systems:** Develop recommendation systems for suggesting loan products or marketing campaigns to individual customers based on their historical interactions and demographics.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the insights and analyses that can be derived from the database once it's set up and populated with data. The specific insights and analyses will depend on the bank's business goals and questions they want to answer using this data.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"af3a46cc-12e6-43d4-9207-78f0b3b8c2f9"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
