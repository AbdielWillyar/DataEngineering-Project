Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

In this project, we will employ PostgreSQL to delve deeper into the data of these international students with the objective of examining whether we can arrive at similar conclusions regarding the impact of studying abroad on the mental well-being of international students. Additionally, we will evaluate whether the length of stay in the host country plays a significant role in their mental well-being. The outcomes of this project are anticipated to provide a better understanding of the challenges faced by international students concerning their mental well-being and serve as a foundation for the development of more effective support efforts for them.
